        To create a pong game with the concept of functional programing and Observables, I used prior knowledege of what I have learnt about Observables from the basicexamples task and examined the concept of each of the examples given.<br>
        From there, I was able to reuse each of the example's concept and modify them such that they would create a functional pong game.
        Some of the major examples which aided me in creating the pong game was the animatedRect and dragRect. These examples aided in being familiar in using Observables and how each map, filter and subscribe function can be applied.
        Other than basicexamples, the svgElement class file and the Observable class file also aided me into understanding how much I was able to tweak my code to create the pong game. Generally there were only slight modifications made
        within the pong.html file such I was able to design my pong game page and make it slightly more unique then the rest. Most of the coding was done within the pong.ts file itself and no other alterations were made for the other files
        provided. Several sound files were added into the folder to allow the game to have sound effects and background music to make it more of a real game.

        Modifications made to the folder:<br>
        - pong.ts was heavily modifed to create the functional a pong game. There was alot of Observable implementation involved for each diverse part of the pong game to actually make it work as a proper game (Further explanation of what I did is located within the Typescript file)
        <br>- functions.ts has been added into the folder to allow certain functions to be used for the pong game and another breakout game
        <br>- pong.html had slight alterations to make it more appealing as a game and a new heading and paragraph element was added to provied instructions for the game. Also added a new reference to functions.js to allow the functions to be used within the document
        <br>- added audio files such as background.mp3 ,bounce.wav, score.wav and wall.wav to allow sound effects to be added for each game
        <br>- A breakout game was also created and added in as well (The files included are breakout.ts and breakout.html)
